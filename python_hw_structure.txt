Have your file structure inside your repos look like this for the python assignments unless otherwise requested in the homework instructions:


      repo_name 
            |__ data/   
            |    |__ file_name.csv
            |
            |__ python_file.py or python_file.ipynb
            |__ README.md
            |__ .gitignore
